# Empathy deck for community organization policies

## Purpose

The purpose of this game is to provide a creative method for groups to challenge their policies, processes and organizational or group attributes from an anti-oppression framework. Players win by identifying the most potentially oppressive attributes, or the organization wins (but all players lose) if the majority of attributes brought up do not appear to disadvantage any of the personas.

## Deck option 1

Deck is composed of:

* headings
* personas 

1. Write down several section headings from the self-eval checklist (e.g., mission, board, etc.) on an index card. There should be at least one section card per player.
2. On another set of index cards, write down fictional personas to represent groups which may or may not benefit from policies or processes. Some example personas are provided which you can print out, and give them a name (link).
Consider personas who may be marginalized based on gender, sexual orientation, race, economic status, language ability, religion preference, age and ability
Diversity is commonly understood to include differences based on race; age; place of origin; religion; ancestry; Aboriginal status; skin colour; citizenship; sex; gender identity; sexual orientation; ethnic origin; disability/ability; marital, parental or family status; same-sex partnership status; creed; language; educational background; literacy level; geographic location; income level; cultural tradition; and work experience

3. Set aside a piece of paper for keeping score and write down each players name as well as the organization name in a final column.
4. Shuffle each set of index cards separately (sections and personas).
5. Sit in a circle and randomly determine a starting player.
6. Each player on their turn draws one card from the section stack and two cards from the persona stack. Then they think of one policy or process (hereafter called an attribute) currently in use in their group or organization and explain why it does or does not benefit each persona. If the attribute benefits one persona and does not benefit the other persona, the player scores a point and the organization loses a point. If both personas benefit, the organization gains three points and the player loses a point. If neither persona benefits, the player gains two points and the organization loses a point.
7. Whenever the organization loses a point, make note of the attribute on a piece of paper. It will be used once the game is over.
8. The player finishes their turn by shuffling the personas cards they took back into the persona stack but holds onto their section card until everyone has taken a turn this round.
9. Play proceeds counter-clockwise around the circle.
10. At the end of the round, all section cards are collected and the section stack is shuffled for the next round.
11. First player to 10 points wins. If the organization scores 10 points before any player gets 10 points, everyone loses.
12. Once the game is over, read over the list of attributes that were recorded during the game and take votes on which should get attention and reconsideration first. 
13. Develop an action plan for addressing the attributes at the top of the list.

## Deck option 2

Desk is composed of cards for:

* personas
* characteristics of personas
* domains of the organization

### Setup

1. Shuffle the persona cards and play two persona cards face up into the middle of the table.
2. Shuffle the characteristics cards and play three characteristic cards next to each persona.
3. Give each persona a name, write it on a sticky note, and read their characteristics aloud to the group.
4. Shuffle the organizational domains cards and place them face down in the middle of the table.
5. Shuffle the role cards and distribute one to each player, laying them face up in front of the player. Each player reads their role aloud and gathers the materials necessary to fulfill their role.

### Play

The game proceeds clockwise by player rounds until all organizational domain cards have been played into the discard pile.

Each player's round consists of three phases:
1. Opening.
2. Ideating.
3. Finding consensus.

#### Opening

The player opens the round by:
1. Drawing an organizational domain card.
2. Reading the card aloud to the group.
3. Placing the card in the discard pile.

#### Ideating

During the *ideating* phase, each player gets a turn. The player who started the round, gets to go first and play proceeds clockwise during the phase. During the ideating phase, players can take any of the following actions during their turn:
1. Pass.
2. Ask for the played organizational card to be re-read aloud.
3. Identify and share with the group an organizational practice, process, or policy which they think disadvantages one or both personas.
4. If everyone passes, skip to the next *Finding consensus* phase and all players lose 2 points.

#### Finding Consensus

Once each player has taken a turn during the *ideating* phase, each player gets to vote on the organizational practice, process or policy which they think most deserves the organization's attention in order to make it more equitable. Each player takes a turn voting, and the player whose share won the vote scores 1 point. In the event of a tie, the player who opened the round settles the tie with an extra vote.

#### Documenting

The opening player completes the round by recording the imperfect organizational practice which was voted as most in need of the organization's attention. If for any reason the opening player is unable to do so, the player to their left records it for them. The player then reads what they recorded aloud and gives the group a chance to add clarifying language.
The opening player has completed their round and play proceeds clockwise.

### Things to keep in mind during play

* Try to minimize problem-solving while playing the game and if it comes up, feel free to gently chime in with "bike rack!" or "bus seat!", signifying that the specific solutions should be parked in the bike rack or sat onto the bus seat in order to be discussed later. If someone does come up with an idea for a solution, acknowledge and record it, but remind the group that the purpose of the game is foremost to identify practices now and decide as a group which ones to tackle in the future as a group.
* Votes are for the shared ideas not for the player. Make sure everyone understands that they are not competing but are playing together.

### After play

Make a plan as a group for what to do next. Some things to address are:

* Who should be involved in coming up with improvements or alternatives to these imperfect practices? How do we get them involved in the discussion?
* When can they start working on improvements?
* What is a reasonable deadline for the working group to resolve or significantly improve the imperfect practice? 
* When do we check back in to assess progress and what do we expect to have been achieved by then?
