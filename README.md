# Anti-oppression organizational self-evaluation.

This is a tool for community organizations and informal groups to self-evaluate their practices from the perspective of an anti-oppression framework. The evaluation takes the form of a checklist (eventually, it will be interactive). The guiding principle in choosing and framing the list items are to help reveal possible inequities with the following two questions:

1. Who benefits from this?
2. Who does not benefit from this? Or benefits differently?

## Why use this?

- It can spark discussions in your group by providing tangible starting points.
- Using this as a group may overcome one of the key challenges to initiating change: gaining a collective awareness of current needs.
- Adapative practices for group require periodic check-ins or evaluations, and these may be cost-prohibitive if relying on external consultants (hence a self-evaluation).
- It can simply be a learning experience if you are unfamiliar or still learning about the anti-oppression framework.
- It's free, costs you only as much time and effort as you are willing to invest into it.

## How to use this?

### As an individual within an organization or group

1. Set aside 5 minutes
2. Answer checklists to the best of your knowledge.
3. Make note of 
4. Ask a colleague or several colleagues to attempt it so that you can compare answers.
5. Consider whether decisional bodies or the board might be perceptive to this.

### As a sub-group of an organization or larger group

1. Plan an agenda for the session (timing recommendations follow)
2. Form a small group (comprising board and staff) for this self-exam
3. Create a safe environment by discussing / addressing: power dynamics, confidentiality, yes-and moment (?), channels for anonymity, ... (20 minutes)
4. Go through the checklist as a group. (estimate 3-5 minutes per person)
5. As a group, identify which items seem most important (you can't change everything at once), and consider assigning a task force to create a plan to address it and to report back.
6. As a group, identify which items you knew least about (you can't learn everything at once) and consider assigning a task force to learn more and report back.
