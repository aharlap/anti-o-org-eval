# Inlcusion toolkit

This is a tool for community organizations and groups to self-evaluate their practices from the perspective of an anti-oppression framework. The evaluation takes the form of a checklist (eventually, it will be interactive). The guiding principle in choosing and framing the list items are to help reveal possible inequities with the following two questions:

1. Who benefits from this?
2. Who does not benefit from this? Or benefits differently?

## Trust, first

In order for the checklist to stimulate useful answers and discussion, it does require that there be trust and safety among the group.

## Why use this?

- It can spark discussions in your group by providing tangible starting points.
- Using this as a group may overcome one of the key challenges to initiating change: gaining a collective awareness of current needs.
- It can simply be a learning experience if you are unfamiliar or still learning about the anti-oppression framework.
- It's free, costs you only as much time and effort as you are willing to invest into it.

## How to use this?

* Prepare by setting up **a space for trust and safety** among the group. Either use trust exercises, or see some suggestions in the instructions around framing the toolkit.
* Approach it with **common purpose**, but ensure that the group invited to use the toolkit has a shared understanding of what they're about to embark on.
* Be **permissive of mistakes** as it takes experience and openness to learn about difference.
* Encourage **time-outs for constructive discussion** provided they are about personal experiences related to what was said, or reactions people want to share constructively.
* If possible, involve people with different levels or domains of decisional power when using the toolkit as a group.
