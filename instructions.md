# Inclusion toolkit / game

Requirements: Number of Players (3-7); Playing Time (Approximately 30 minutes); Age (12+).

## Objective

This game can help you foster empathy and inclusion in your organization. Let it inspire you to review your policies and practices from an anti-oppression framework. Form a small group from your organization's board and staff. In subsequent games, include stakeholders from your community. As you dive in, remember that these are difficult conversations. So, be gentle and permissive of making mistakes. Take a timeout to address tensions should they arise. If you commit to working through challenging discussions as a group it will be the first step to creating a more inclusive organization and society.

## Components

* Instruction booklet
* 55 characteristic cards
* 20 domain cards (2 of each)
* 10? blank characteristic cards

## Description of cards

### Characteristic cards

>example image goes here

Characteristic cards represent specific facets of fictional personas, which may cause a persona to be disadvantaged by an organizational practice or policy.

### Domain cards

>example image goes here

The organizational domain cards describe particular domains or aspects of an organization, with some suggestions on policies or practices to consider within these.

* governance and leadership
* finance, operations, administration
* resource mobilization
* human resources management
* program management
* communication
* monitoring, evaluation reporting, and knowledge management
* advocacy, networking, and alliance building
* service delivery and quality assurance
* coordination and collaboration

### Blank characteristic cards

Create your own characteristic cards!

## Setup

To set up a game:

1. Shuffle the characteristics cards and play two sets of four characterstics cards face-up into the middle of the table. Each group of cards form the a persona. If a persona has multiple characteristics of the same category (e.g., young age and senior age), replace the second card drawn with a new card from the characteristics deck. Set the characteristics cards aside, you won't need them for the rest of the game.
2. Give each persona a name, write it on a sticky note, and read their characteristics aloud to the group.
3. Shuffle the organizational domains cards. 
4. Deal each player one domain card, face down.
5. Place the remaining domain cards face down in the middle of the table as a draw pile.

#### Optionally, adding roles?

6. Shuffle the role cards.
7. Deal each player one role card, face up. 
8. Each player reads their role card aloud. Each player also gathers any materials necessary to fulfill their role.

## How to Play

The game is played in a series of rounds until all organizational domain cards are discarded.

During each player's round, play the following phases:
1. Opening
2. Ideation
3. Voting

### Opening phase

During the opening phase, the player will:
1. Read their domain card aloud to the group.
2. Place the domain card face up in the discard pile.

### Ideation phase

During the ideation phase, each player can perform any of the following actions:
* Identify an organizational policy or process which disadvantages one or both personas.
​* Ask for the domain card to be re-read aloud.
* Pass your turn.
 
If all players pass their turn, the group lose 2 points per player and the current round ends.

### Voting phase

Take turns voting for the least inclusive or most unjust process or policy. When voting, choose the policy or process which you feel most deserves your organization's attention to address the issue.
The group scores a point for every process or policy which got at least two votes.

### End of a Round

The opening player, or a designated note-taker, jots down the process or policy which won the vote. Read the notes aloud so that everyone has a chance to add clarifying language.

The opening player's round ends. Play proceeds clockwise.

### End of the Game

The game ends under the following conditions:

* The group reaches 10 points; everyone wins!
* A player abandons the game; stalemate!

See the section *After play*, below, for suggestions on how you can continue the process after wrapping up the game.

## Tips

#### During play

* Avoid problem-solving during the game. If it does come up, acknowledge and record possible solutions. It is will be easier and more useful to have those discussions after the game is over.
* Avoid getting competitive. Vote for ideas not for players. If people get competitive, read them this guideline: Work as a team to make your organization more inclusive.

#### After play

Make a plan as a group for what to do next. Key questions to address include:

1. Who do we involve in discussions on solutions to these imperfect practices? How can we involve them?
2. When can they start working on improvements?
3. What is a reasonable deadline for the working group to resolve or significantly improve the imperfect practice? 
4. When do we check in as a group to assess progress? What do we expect to achieve by then?
