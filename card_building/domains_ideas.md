# So many ways to slice the org cake

## Organizational Domain categorizations

* Areas of organizations traditionally considered when assessing organizational capacity; see OCATs
* Areas of organization considered when conducting an anti-o audit; e.g.,OHCC's toolkit

* Or focus just on areas most typically problematic
    - HR policies
    - governance / staff transparency / permeability
    - conflict resolution (policies & practices)
    - governance election & approval process
    - outreach (programs, board recruitement, staff recruitment)

## Other possibly categorization axes

    - Generative (opening new doors)
    - Steering (adjusting directions)
    - Stewarding (creating opportunities for review / continued care)
    - Disruptive (removing obstacles and barriers)

* Groupings of characteristic which are likely affected (complicated!)
* Most common to least common problem areas (biased!)

* Types of details for each domain
    - communication / voice / representation / feedback
    - policies & practices
    - roles & responsibilities
    - documentation / accessibility
